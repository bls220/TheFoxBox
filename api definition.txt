Current definition of api:

	Every message (android to go, go to android) consists of a JSON object.
	The object is sent like normal text, but is prepended by the length of the json object.
		The length is encoded as a 4-byte little-endian value.

Also the Go program is going to run on port 5853
		
JSON descriptions:
	Ping/Pong:
		At any time, the Android device may want to test the connection without adding load to the server.
		It also is useful for checking to make sure an AuthToken is valid.
		To do this, simply pass the following thing:
		
		-Request: "ping"
		-AuthToken: The token retrieved from logging in
		-Params:
			(None)
		-Returns:
			A JSON object with the Request variable set to "pong" if the AuthToken is valid. Else there will
			be no return value.
	A song list:
		-Request: "songlist"; "search"; whatever request caused the songlist to be returned
		-Songs: (A list of the following objects)
			-Album: string
			-Artist: string
			-Title: string
			-Id: An id for the song. This id is important because it is what you have to send to the server when requesting/voting on a song

	When requesting the queue:
		-Request: "songlist"
		-AuthToken: The token retrieved from logging in
		-Params:
			(None)
			
	When logging in:

			-Name: Name of the user
			// TODO: probably need to add some more fields here
